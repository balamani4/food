<p class="light pt-3">Restaurateurs excel at developing creative ideas for a business, serving delicious food, and creating fantastic guest experiences. And now, increasingly, a critical component of that guest experience is digital. Your website is the new front door of your business.

  As your restaurant perfects your digital ordering and takeout and delivery offerings, it’s more important than ever that your restaurant website is well-optimized, making it easy for guests to discover your restaurant online and find exactly what they’re looking for. Your website is the foundation of your restaurant marketing strategy.
  
  Restaurant owners now have a unique opportunity to tailor their guests’ experiences, both online and in-person, to build loyalty and turn casual guests into consistent regulars. With 89% of diners researching restaurants online before visiting in-person, your website is the platform for your guests' first interaction with your business.
  
  Whether you're building the site yourself or hiring someone to do it for you, the most important aspect of creating an effective restaurant website design is that it efficiently conveys critical information while also enticing new customers. </p>

</div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 pl-5 pt-5 text-success">
    <p>We travel around the world to experience the different cultures and heritages, to taste the exotic dishes that represent the countries, to acquire knowledge and most importantly, to witness the beauties every country posses. But for various reasons, whether it is monetary or lack of time management or holidays, it is always impossible to travel so much. It is said that if you want to see a country without visiting it, then try their local dishes. The food will tell you a lot about the country.</p>

</div>
<div class="col-sm-6 pl-5 pt-5 text-success">
<p>Cheesecake is a kind of rich sweet tart made with cream and fresh cheese (typically cream cheese or ricotta) on a biscuit base.

  The first “cheese cake” was created on the Greek island of Samos. Physical anthropologists excavated cheese moldsthere which were dated circa 2,000 BC.
  
  The Ancient Greeks used the simple ingredients of flour, wheat, honey and cheese formed into a cake and baked.</p>

</div>
<div class="col-sm-6 pl-5 pt-4 text-success">
<p>From restaurant style gravy recipes (like palak paneer) to homestyle curries (like aloo matar) to curries made with legumes (like black eyed peas curry) to kofta curries (like malai kofta), there is something for everyone here.

  TIP: Double or triple the recipe and make a big batch and freeze. It makes a good freezer meal that just needs to be heated on the stove!</p>

<p>It's summer which means that lotus stem, pumpkins, okra, litchi and watermelons are in the season. The market bristles with sun-kissed mangoes and deep-green vegetables, so all you need is an expert to guide you through what to cook. According to Dr. Shalini Singhal, founder & chief nutrition consultant at Diet and wellness clinic, Delhi says “Make sure to eat a light and early dinner in the summer. Include a whole lot of vegetables, some proteins like beans and pulses for vegetarians and meat or fish for non-vegetarians.”</p>

<h2 class="card-title text-center p-3 text-info">Arepa Lady</h3>

</div>
<div class="col-sm-6 pl-5 pt-1 text-success">
<p>After several months of searching for a location, Arepa Lady reopened on October 6 on 37th Avenue near 78th Street in Jackson Heights, reports The Jackson Heights Post. Queens residents have been anticipating the street food classic’s return since the developer behind a seven-story mixed-use apartment complex received the necessary permits to raze the old location on 77-02A Roosevelt Avenue last summer.

  Maria Cano, a former judge and the restaurant’s founder, has been making arepas in Queens since she fled violence in Colombia roughly three decades ago. She started Arepa Lady as a modest food cart before upgrading to a brick-and-mortar shop in 2014 due to popular demand.</p>

</div>
<div class="col-sm-6 pl-5 pt-1 text-success">
<p>Butter chicken originated in Delhi, the capital territory of India, sometime during the 1950s. During this time, a man named Kundan Lal Gurjal operated a restaurant in the city, called Moti Mahal. Kundan had settled here and started his business after fleeing from political upheaval in another region of India. Moti Mahal was a success, serving many delightful tandoori dishes (a tandoor is a circular clay oven, and can be found in any Indian restaurant worth its salt).
